Galaxy stellar population SED modelling, for stellar mass estimation with
rigorous error propagation. Inference of stellar population parameters (mass,
age, redshift etc) is performed using a simple homegrown MCMC sampler, with
model selection via the Bayesian information criterion. As well as this
primary script, the package comes with other subsidiary scripts, including the
colour prediction and K-correction generation tool mag2mag.

History: 
   2008-10-30  Started basic codebase
   

Dependencies:
   matplotlib
     scipy
     numpy
     ipython
     pyfits

   All of these should be available for package managers of most *nix
   distributions - under Fedora, "yum install matplotlib" takes care of almost
   everything automatically.   


Installation notes:
   The stellarpop codebase is available via cvs from the KIPAC cvs server; cvs
   update to get the latest version of the code. 
   $cwd/stellarpop  must be added to your PATH and PYTHONPATH, with eg
     setenv $PATH $PATH:$cwd/stellarpop
     setenv $PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:$cwd/stellarpop


Operation notes:   
   The stellarpop code is self-documenting:
   
     stellarmass -h
     mag2mag -h
     
   give brief introductions to the scripts.
